#Flux-A-Duck

**Because your Actions file is enormous**

---

Flux-A-Duck takes the [traditional flux protocol](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html), hides the complicated bits, and gives you only the methods you need in one convenient API wrapper. This way you can keep the methods used to access your data close to the Components that depend on it... Or you can put them on the moon. The point is that you can break your store functions and actions into bite sized components that go anywhere while retaining the single event loop style of Flux.
